# Experiments in Chaining Shaders

This contains some experiments in chaining shaders in 2 ways.

The root level directories `scenes`, `scene_scripts`, and `shaders` contains standalone scenes the run shaders that generate images in the `output` folder wheneven the mouse is clicked in the window.

The output images from some of these shaders (particularly the noise shader) can be fed back into the other scenes to accomplish the chaining.

The directories in `compact_scenes` contain attempts to contain the complete shader chain within a single scene.

This whole project is experimental in nature.
